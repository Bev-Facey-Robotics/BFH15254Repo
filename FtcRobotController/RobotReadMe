Hello, and welcome to Cyberflex's (FTC #15254) Code repository! This is where we keep all of our code up to date while collaberating with the two coders on our team.
The list here is by no means extensive, but a few things we've done and are working on
    a. A working auto using apriltags
    b. Drivecode using vector math (Preloading was bored and wrote some because Java didn't have it natively supported)
    c. Our engineering journal for judging presentation
    d. Keeping our sponsers up to date on what we've been doing
    e. Doing outreach and fundraising for the team

Feel free to borrow our code if you simply want to take a look at how it was written or if you want to keep track of our current progress, take a look at our project board. This will show you all the current and past issues we've tackled and are working on

Thank you for visiting our github page!
