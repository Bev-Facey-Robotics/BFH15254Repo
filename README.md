## NOTICE

This repository uses the FTC SDK as a base for our code. You can clone it here: git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git

## Welcome!
This repository contains the code that Team 15254 used to control and score points in the First tech Challange "Into the Deep",

## Requirements
To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio 2021.2 or later. Feel free to take a look at how we did code if it helps you. The SDK will be updated when new updates are released for the SDK, however we make no promises in maintaining the code post-season

## Note!
The code does contain sample opmodes for your robot. We do not claim that as our own work, and we do not take credit for it. All credit for the sample opmodes goes to the FTC SDK team.
